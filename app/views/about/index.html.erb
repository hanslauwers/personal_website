  <div class="about-text">
    I am a web developer with six years of professional experience in programming for the web and 6 more years of academic experience in server-side programming in general. I am comfortable with different server-side and client-side technologies and I enjoy working with both, especially on the same project. Professionally, I have developed an expertise in SharePoint-based web development. After my workdays are done, I like to do small projects in Ruby on Rails, improving this particular skill since August 2017.
    <br/>Being part of a team helps me thrive in any environment, whether it's at work or on the football pitch (or, soccer pitch for my American friends).<br/>
    Problem-solving is my favorite past-time. I've worn many hats on different projects: a programmer, a functional analyst, a technical analyst, a project leader, an architect, a test manager,... though if the project allows for it, my preference is to focus on my first love of programming.<br/><br/>
    I am fluent in English, French and my native Dutch and speak and write in all three on a daily basis.<br/>
    My eternal quest is to tackle new challenges, formulate new ideas, dive into new technologies and meet new people.
