  A bit of info...<br/><br/>
  I am a web developer with six years of professional experience in programming for the web and 6 more years of academic experience in server-side programming in general. I am comfortable with different server-side and client-side technologies and I enjoy working with both. Being part of a team helps me thrive in any environment, whether it's at work or on the football pitch (or, soccer pitch for my American friends).<br />
  Problem-solving is my favorite past-time. I've worn many hats on different projects: a programmer, a functional analyst, a technical analyst, a project leader, an architect, a test manager,... though if the project allows for it, my preference is to focus on my first love of programming.<br/>
  I am fluent in English, French and my native Dutch and speak and write in all three on a daily basis.<br/>
  I am on an eternal quest to tackle new challenges, formulate new ideas, dive into new technologies and meet new people.
